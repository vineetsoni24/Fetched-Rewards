Hello,

Thank you for providing with data. Based on a premilimary analysis of the data, I wanted to share a few concerns about the data quality. 
1. Non-atomic data: Several fields in the data have non-atomic data i.e. multiple attributes in a single column which does not comply with the relational database
structure and hence makes querying and analysing the data highly challenging. For eg. List of items bought under a particular receipt number is also present in a 
single column and analyzing sales based on items becomes very challenging. Also, cpg column brands data has both the cpg_id as well as cpg_ref.
2. Missing Data: There are multiple occurrences of missing data in the table. 
3. Data inconsistency: There are several occurences of data inconsistency, for eg. list of items under a certain receipt may have values for different attributes. 
If there is a possibility of reducing the number of columns by making attrbutes consistent across items, it could help in gathering better insights from the data.
4. Duplicate values: There a several cases of duplicate values especially in the users dataset. Users data has information about 495 users but the ID column of
users has only 212 unique values.

In order to create a consistent and reliable database, the above concerns that have come up from a preliminary analysis will need to be taken care of. A set of data
acquisition and storage guidelines can be put in place that will ensure consistency across datasets. To start off this process, a relational database system can be 
implemented which would help in creating atomic data with consitency. As the first step, an ERD will have to be created that can ensure in exhaustive and efficient
data collection and storage with minimal redundancy. ERD can worked out by collaborating with other functions as it will help in creating a robust database system.
A relational databse may ensure smoother and consistent flow of data that could help in productionizing analytical models that may improve business and operational 
efficiency. 
Feel free to reach out in case of any concerns and we can setup a meeting to discuss the way forward.

Thanks and regards,

Vineet Suhas Soni
